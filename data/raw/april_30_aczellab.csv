Informed Consent and Description of Research


You are cordially invited to participate in a research study coordinated by Prof. Balazs Aczel, ELTE Budapest, Hungary (aczel.balazs@ppk.elte.hu). This study aims to explore the emotional landscape of scientific research, mapping out the affects and emotions that researchers commonly experience when conducting different stages of their main research project. The study consists of a series of questions and poses minimal risk of discomfort (other than the discomfort caused by completing regular or daily tasks). Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to complete the survey on your own terms (i.e., choosing to take breaks, skip questions, or even terminate completion without any repercussions). The survey is quite short, and the estimated time for completion is approximately 5 minutes. Aside from personal satisfaction (stemming from your support of the overall advancement of science), there are no other compensations for your participation.

The results of this study will be used in scientific outputs (publications and conference presentations). Data will be collected anonymously during the study, and no personal data will be obtained. All information collected during the research process will be handled strictly and confidentially. Data obtained during the research is stored as coded information in a secured computer. The assistant in charge provides the individual codes, which are accessible and known only to them. Research data will be analyzed statistically, during which no personal identification will be possible. All anonymized data will be openly shared on public repositories. By proceeding, you agree that data collected on your person - which cannot be identified as those belonging to your person - may be used for research purposes and will be accessible to other researchers and the general public.

I reserve the right to terminate my participation at any time, in which case the data belonging to my person should be erased. I declare that I am over 18 years of age. I have received detailed information concerning the conditions of my participation in the study.
